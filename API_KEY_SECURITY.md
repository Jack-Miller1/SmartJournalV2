# 🔐 API Key Security Guide

## 🚨 **CRITICAL: Protect Your OpenAI API Key**

Your OpenAI API key is like a credit card - if someone gets it, they can charge your account!

## ✅ **Current Security Measures:**

### **1. Environment Variable Storage**
- ✅ API key stored in `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
- ✅ Never committed to git (protected by `.gitignore`)
- ✅ Only accessible to your Railway app

### **2. Validation & Masking**
- ✅ API key format validation (must start with 'sk-')
- ✅ Masked logging (only first 8 characters visible)
- ✅ Error handling prevents key exposure

### **3. Railway Security**
- ✅ Environment variables encrypted in Railway
- ✅ Only accessible to your deployed app
- ✅ Not visible in logs or error messages

## 🛡️ **Additional Protection Steps:**

### **1. Set Usage Limits in OpenAI Dashboard**
1. Go to [platform.openai.com/usage](https://platform.openai.com/usage)
2. Click "Set usage limits"
3. Set monthly spending limit (e.g., $10-20)
4. Enable email alerts for usage

### **2. Monitor Usage Regularly**
- Check OpenAI dashboard weekly
- Look for unexpected usage spikes
- Set up billing alerts

### **3. Rotate Keys Periodically**
- Generate new API key monthly
- Update Railway environment variable
- Delete old key from OpenAI dashboard

## 🚨 **What to Do If Key is Compromised:**

### **Immediate Actions:**
1. **Delete the compromised key** in OpenAI dashboard
2. **Generate a new key** immediately
3. **Update Railway** environment variable
4. **Check usage** for unauthorized charges

### **Prevention:**
- Never share API keys in chat/email
- Never commit keys to git
- Use different keys for different projects
- Monitor usage regularly

## 🔍 **How to Check Your Key is Safe:**

### **In Railway:**
1. Go to your project dashboard
2. Click on your app service
3. Go to "Variables" tab
4. Verify `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set (value hidden)

### **In Your App:**
- Check logs for: `✅ OpenAI API key loaded: sk-12345678********`
- If you see the full key, there's a problem!

## 💡 **Best Practices:**

1. **Use separate keys** for development and production
2. **Set spending limits** ($10-20/month for testing)
3. **Monitor usage** weekly
4. **Rotate keys** monthly
5. **Never log full keys** (current implementation is safe)

## 🎯 **Your Current Setup is Secure!**

- ✅ Key stored in environment variables
- ✅ Protected by `.gitignore`
- ✅ Masked in logs
- ✅ Railway encrypts environment variables
- ✅ Error handling prevents exposure

**Your API key is safe!** 🛡️
